# Reactor_sim_mc
Simple Monte Carlo based reactor simulation, written for physics 1st year project at Copenhagen university.

The zip file contains all the neccessary data to simulate fission inside a 2D 5x5 grid reactor. There are two Jupytur notebook files, one which is ready for 1000x100 simulation and one basic simulation.
Comments to the code are all in danish.
